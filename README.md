# lazyrun

Lazyrun is a utility to run various useful tools in containers as if they were
installed natively.

one](https://cirrus-ci.com/task/5125306349518848).

Add the `apps/` directory to your path.

## TODO

* [X] sbt PoC
* [ ] turn sbt into a more sensible container (no weird paths)
* [ ] move from scripts to config
* [ ] ability to turn apps on or off
* [ ] overlays over default list - or list of lists
